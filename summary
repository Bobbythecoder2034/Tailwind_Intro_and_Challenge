Tailwind CSS is a CSS framework that removes the hassle of long CSS files. It has tons of compiled classes and CSS combinations that can be easily added to elements.
Bootstrap websites lack originality due to the design of the CSS classes. They require extensive customization to produce a unique feel. Basic CSS has a lot of excess text that takes a long time to test. Tailwind has such a wide variety of inputs and custom classes that bootstrap becomes obsolete. It is also much more efficient than base CSS.
Utility classes are simple HTML classes controlled by one CSS property. They can be used to dynamically style an object.
